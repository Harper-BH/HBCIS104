def = fctn
def Function():
  ieofwejfoofifwoifje
 can call fctn with something inside or not
 save = Fctn(a + b):
 def Fctn(a + b):
     a + b = year
     print(year)
   def fctn(a + b) ~ need both values
   def fctn (a=0 + b) ~ only need b but can have a
   def fctn (a = 0 + b = 0) ~ dont need any but can have both
"something" = string literal
+ for strings = combine
len = length fctn
string slicing~ print(s[0:5]) ~ first 5 letters
in operator ~ "f" in fruit ~~ true
.lower makes lowercase
.find(" ")
.lower
.upper
.replace("something", "something")
strip() removes whitespace ~ lstrip rstrip
.startswith(" ") = does it start with sokething

**ARRAYS**
index is the number in the array
starts at 0
[] = indexes
{} = dict
can be changed
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list[2] = 3
range = all the numbers from 0 to 1 under that number
+ operator joins 2 lists together
listname.append adds the next number to the list
4 in listname
4 not in listname
max, min, sum, len-all usable
elements = "1 2 3"
elements.split()
elements= = [1, 2, 3]
